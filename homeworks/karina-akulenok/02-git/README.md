I'm going to start working as a junior Front-End developer at an IT company this year. I want to help people realize creative ideas, as well as implement my own startup. I am always learning something new and taking various courses to improve my skills and be more in demand. I am very ambitious and always go to the end.

2. Subdued robots, forcing to entertain humanity with dances
3. Having studied the secrets of the physics of our galaxy, I was able to command lightning (though only at the Tesla show)
